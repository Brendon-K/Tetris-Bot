# Tetris-Bot
A program that plays Tetris (NES) on its own

**Note:** I decided to put the "plays" functionality on hold. After doing some research it seems that using Python to send inputs to an application on Mac could be a lot more tedious than I was expecting.  
Due to this, I'm going to spend more time working on the algorithm that finds the best position for the next piece. If I get that working well, *then* I'll look more into how I can control the application through code so it can play itself.
